 * You may want to look at the 'Planet' example in the Oracle enum tutorial for
 * an example of how to associate state (radius, density in that case) with each
 * item in the enumeration.

    /**
     * Return indicies corresponding to which board squares would be covered
     * by this mask given the provided placement.
     *
     * The placement character describes the place as follows:
     *    - letters 'A' to 'D' describe the first quadrant of the board,
     *      corresponding to board positions 0-8.
     *    - letters 'E' to 'H' describe the second quadrant of the board,
     *      corresponding to board positions 9-17.
     *    - letters 'I' to 'L' describe the third quadrant of the board,
     *      corresponding to board positions 18-26.
     *    - letters 'M' to 'P' describe the fourth quadrant of the board,
     *      corresponding to board positions 27-35.
     *    - letters 'A', 'E', 'I', and 'M' describe the mask upright
     *    - letters 'B', 'F', 'J', and 'N' describe the mask turned 90 degrees clockwise
     *    - letters 'C', 'G', 'K', and 'O' describe the mask turned 180 degrees
     *    - letters 'D', 'H', 'L', and 'P' describe the mask turned 270 degrees clockwise
     *
     * Examples:
     *
     *   Given the placement character 'A', the mask 'W' would return the indices: {0,1,3,4,5,6,8}.
     *   Given the placement character 'O', the mask 'X' would return the indices: {27,28,29,30,32,33,35}.
     *
     *
     * Hint: You can associate values with each entry in the enum using a constructor,
     * so you could use that to somehow encode the properties of each of the four masks.
     * Then in this method you could use the value to calculate the required indicies.
     *
     * The tutorial here: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/enum.html
     * has an example of a Planet enum, which includes two doubles in each planet's
     * constructor representing the mass and radius.   Those values are used in the
     * surfaceGravity() method, for example.
     *
     * @param placement A character describing the placement of this mask, as per the above encoding
     * @return A set of indices corresponding to the board positions that would be covered by this mask

     * four characters composing the mask position string describe the
     * positions and rotations of each of four masks.
     *
     * The first character in the string describes the position and rotation
     * of the 'W' mask.  The second, third and fourth describe the positions
     * of the 'X', 'Y', and 'Z' positions respectively.
     *
     * If the character is a space ' ', then that means that the given mask
     * is not used.   Otherwise the encoding described above in getIndices() is used.
     *
     * Hint: The values() method of any enum type will return an array of the values in the enum.
     *

     * char arrays (.toCharArray()), and you can create new strings from
     * char arrays.
